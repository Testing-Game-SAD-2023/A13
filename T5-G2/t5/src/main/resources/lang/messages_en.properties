punteggio_intro=Welcome to our testing gamification challenge! Discover how to maximize your score and climb the leaderboard. We've designed a scoring system that rewards your strategy and skills while balancing the difficulty of the classes to test.

criteri_punteggio=Scoring Criteria:

copertura_titolo=Private Method Coverage
copertura_descrizione1=The more private methods you cover in a class, the greater your advantage.
copertura_descrizione2=Each private method covered is calculated relative to the total private methods in the class.
copertura_hint=Pay attention to details and unlock hidden bonuses!

complessita_titolo=Cyclomatic Complexity
complessita_descrizione1=Tackling complex classes is not for everyone: if you handle them well, your score will reflect your effort.
complessita_descrizione2=We evaluate how many iterative and selection constructs you have covered relative to the total in the class.
complessita_hint=The greater the complexity, the bigger the reward.

penalita_titolo=Penalty for Additional Turns
penalita_descrizione1=Every extra turn will cost you points.
penalita_descrizione2=For each turn, your score is reduced by an auto-incrementing factor.
penalita_hint=Want to avoid penalties? Cover the maximum in the first turn!

bonus_titolo=First-Turn Coverage Bonus
bonus_descrizione1=If you exceed 75% coverage on the first turn, you will earn an extra multiplier based on difficulty:
bonus_difficolta_media=Medium Difficulty: 10% bonus.
bonus_difficolta_difficile=Hard Difficulty: 30% bonus.
bonus_hint=An explosive first turn is worth double!

difficolta_titolo=Total Difficulty Factor
difficolta_descrizione1=The score takes into account the difficulty of the bot and the class under test:
difficolta_bot=Harder bots reward you more.
difficolta_classi=More complex classes, with many private methods and more lines of code, increase your multiplier value.
difficolta_hint=Take on the right level to challenge yourself and earn more!

punteggio_finale_titolo=Final Score
punteggio_finale_descrizione=Your score is calculated by summing your coverage, bonuses obtained, and applied multipliers. Climb the leaderboard!

gioca_strategico_titolo=Play Strategically and Win
gioca_strategico_descrizione=Aim to maximize coverage on the first turn, carefully choosing the bot's difficulty and the classes. Every decision counts to reach the podium!
